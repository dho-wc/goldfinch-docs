## Frequently asked estate planning questions

### What is a will and why is it called a Last Will and Testament?
A will is a document that states your wishes for your property after your death. The phrase last will can be misleading because when you update your will, you are going to name the new will in the same way, last will. To know which one is legally effective, you need to check the date on the document. Similarly, “will and testament” mean the same thing; it’s a traditional legal phrase, much like “cease and desist.” The reason we still use “Last Will and Testament” today is largely due to history and tradition. At its core, it’s simply a will.

### Why is it important to have a will?
A will ensures that your wishes are honored, your loved ones are cared for, and your assets are distributed as you intend. Without a will, state laws determine how your assets are divided and who receives them.

### Who is allowed to create a will?
Any competent person of sound mind who is at least 18 years of age can create a will, so long as they do so willingly and not under duress or undue influence.

### If I create a will, why do I need other documents?
It is often said that a will speaks at death, meaning that it has no legal effect during your lifetime. So, what if you are incapacitated and unable to manage your own affairs? In that situation, your will won’t help, you would need a Durable Financial Power of Attorney and a Healthcare Power of Attorney to allow someone to manage your finances and make healthcare decisions on your behalf.

### What if I already have a will?
As life changes, so should your will. You might need to change your beneficiaries or who should manage and distribute your assets. Or maybe you got married or divorced. Whatever life throws at you, we make it easy to update your will. Just create a new one here and it will revoke your prior will, so you don’t have to do anything special to make sure it no longer applies. But this is only true after your new will is properly signed and witnessed.

### Can I include charities, and can I give specific items to specific beneficiaries?
Yes. You can give specific items, specific dollar amounts, or a percentage of your assets to any beneficiary you want, including charities.

### What is a beneficiary?
A beneficiary is a person or charity (or other organization) that receives some part of your assets after your death. In your will, you can clearly list all beneficiaries and the gifts they are to receive, whether a specific item, a specific dollar amount, or a percentage of your assets.

### Who should I appoint to manage and distribute my assets after my death?
You should appoint someone you trust who is responsible and organized. This is usually a family member or close friend, but can also be a professional, such as the family attorney.

### Is the online will legally binding?
Yes, once properly signed and witnessed, your will is legally binding. Our online will package is designed by attorneys with significant experience in the field of wills and trusts, and you will receive signing instructions as part of the package. Our wills are state-specific, so it’s important that you sign it in your state of residence.

### What is a Durable Financial Power of Attorney?
A financial power of attorney authorizes another person to handle your financial affairs when you are unable to do so. As a general rule of law, a financial power of attorney is ineffective when you are incapacitated unless it states otherwise, in which case it endures your incapacity; hence the use of the word durable in the name.

### What is a Healthcare Power of Attorney?
A healthcare power of attorney authorizes another person to make healthcare decisions for you when you are unable to do so. This document goes by various names, including Advance Healthcare Directive and Healthcare Proxy.

### What is a HIPAA Authorization?
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requires insurers and others in possession of your health information to keep that information private. As such, even your loved ones are not able to access your health information without authorization from you. The HIPAA Authorization does just that, allowing certain people to access your health information when needed, such as when you are incapacitated.

### What is a Living Will?
This document can go by various names, including Advance Directive or Physician’s Directive. It allows you to give your attending physician authority to withhold life-sustaining care in certain limited circumstances. Without this authority, your loved ones could find it difficult to have life-sustaining care withheld when it makes sense to do so.

### Is a handwritten will valid in the US?
In many states, a handwritten will (also called a holographic will) can be valid, but the rules vary. Some states accept them only if the will is entirely in your handwriting and signed by you. Others may also require the will to be dated. A few states don’t allow handwritten wills at all. Even when they are accepted, handwritten wills are more likely to be unclear or challenged in court. To make sure your wishes are carried out, it’s usually best to prepare a typed will that meets your state’s formal requirements.

### Do I need a lawyer to make a will?
You don’t have to hire a lawyer to make a will in the US. Most states allow you to write your own will or use an online service, as long as the document meets legal requirements, such as being signed and properly witnessed. However, a lawyer can help ensure your will is legally sound, covers all your assets, and avoids potential disputes. If you have a blended family, own real estate in more than one state, or want to create trusts, getting legal advice is strongly recommended.

### What happens if I die without a will?
If you die without a will in the United States, state intestacy laws determine who inherits your property. Typically, your spouse and children come first. If you don’t have a spouse or children, your parents, siblings, or other relatives may inherit. This process can be very different from what you would have chosen, and it can take longer and cost more for your loved ones. Having a will gives you control over how your estate is divided and can make the probate process easier for your family.
